# hnsv2.psm1
PowerShell functions to manage the lifecycle of HNS resources.

## Usage
```
ipmo .\hns.v2.psm1
```

## Difference between hns.psm1 and hns.v2.psm1
These can be used interchangably, but highly recommend hns.v2.psm1 as it uses V2 API and is up to date. V2 API is supported on Windows Server 2019 and above. hns.psm1 and V1 API has not been updated since 2018.
